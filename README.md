### About the Repo


One of my passions is photography, and to build my online presence - it was only right that I built an online portfolio. Through this website, users are able to see my works, which services I offer and learn who I am.

I've re-built this website four times now, and each time has been better as I learned to leverage better design concepts but also how to write cleaner code 🔥.

### Coming Soon!

To learn more about NodeJS and essentially how to write server-side code, I'll be implementing a Store👜 aspect to the website where users will be able to purchase the various services I can provide. Stay tuned 😎.
